# AcronymJavaPuzzle

## I tried this conversion challenge with the knowledge of Java I had gained through the Data Academy and a little knowledge I had prior
to this. (I realise I spelt the class name wrong)

_1)_ First of all I created the array of Strings in which needed to be converted.

_2)_ A For loop to parse through the pre-converted acronyms.

_3)_ I wanted to use regex as I was comfortable using this without googling. And so I split the strings every time there was an uppercase
letter, making it a little easier to convert the basic acronyms such as HyperText Markup Language.

_4)_ Then another For loop to search through the newly formatted array to retrieve the uppercase letters and join them together.

_5)_ A simple replaceAll regex to remove whitespace.

_6)_ Realised I could probably use replaceAll to fix every acronym, but without Googling I couldn't remember enough from my training
to complete this task fully.
